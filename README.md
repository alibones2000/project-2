# Your Resource for Studio Ghibili Movies
This single page application uses information from external API (https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) to create a db.jon file encompassing many Studio Ghibili movies. Our page allows users to view the information of the displayed movies including title, image, description, director,and release date. Users can toggle between the original title and the romanticized version by clicking on the image of the movie. They can also save their top titles in the "Favorites Menu" by clicking on the Fav button and search for titles based on the name or director of the movie. Finally, users can use the form to add new Studio Ghibili movies using the name, image, and release date.
